I built a simple clock app and made it into a progressive web app over the last week. I'm back playing with web development and JavaScript and wanted to see how siple it was to make a Progressive Web App (PWA). It turns out it was fairly simple, I used this [guide][pwa] over one [freecodecamp.org][fcc], I love that site. I just took out the bits I needed from the article and adapted them to my own JS Clock.
I actually ended up hosting the Clock and azure too, which was a nice little additional learning exercise, not really much to earn it's very plug and play from the github [source][source] code. Have a look at the source if you like, let me know if you think I can make some improvements, I'm just learning JS.
The app can be found linked on my projects page and here: [https://clock.securelee.uk][clock]
