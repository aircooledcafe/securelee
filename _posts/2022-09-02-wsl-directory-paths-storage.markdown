I keep forgetting where Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) stores it's data, so I can navigate to it from file explorer. So just a quick post for reference:

`\\wsl$\`

If you want to jump straight to a specific distribution:

`\\wsl$\<distribution>`

So for Ubuntu-22.04:

`\\wsl$\Ubuntu-22.04`
