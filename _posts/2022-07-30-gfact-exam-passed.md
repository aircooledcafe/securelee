Today I passed finished my SANS SEC275 course by passing the final exam and achieved my [GIAC Foundational Cybersecurity Technologies][gfact] certificate. It only small step but my first step on a journey to a new career. Next up I'm working through the SANS SEC401 Security Essentials course, which is a lot more involved! But today we celebrate!
