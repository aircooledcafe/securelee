Today I passed finished my SANS SEC401 course by passing the final exam and achieved my [GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC)][gsec] certificate. This was far more challenging that the GFACT I pased in July but it feels far more of an achievement too, I also had two end of module assesments to finsih up during the same period for my Computer Science degree. So juggling the differeing knowledge and studying was a bit of challenge for me as I tend to like to focus on learning one new thing at a time. Now I am looking for emplyment, though hearing back from employers seems to be not happening. At least today I get to celebrate!
