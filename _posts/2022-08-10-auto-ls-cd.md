Hot tip if you use zsh, which I do. I pretty much always want to list the contents of a directory after I `cd` into it, which you can achieve using zsh [hook][hook] functions. Just add the following to your .zshrc and your good to go, this can be used to run any command you like after a directory change.
  
{% highlight config %}
function chpwd() {
    ls
}
{% endhighlight %}
