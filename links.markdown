A list of useful links I find around the web and may want ot return too.

***

#### [Virtualization Applications Are Not Working: What Do You Do?][vmware] 
An article about VMWare and Hyper-V coexisting and some solutions and fixes for issues.

***

#### [Git in Two Minutes][git]
A really good guide to git and it's fundamental commands. Really handy as I use several regularly but most I forget every time I come back to them.

***
   
#### [Markdown Syntax Basics][markdown]
As I am new to using markdown a handy reference guide for formatting and syntax was needed. I ahve found this one well laid out and sufficiently detailed for my needs.

***

#### [2FA Directory][directory]
A pretty comprehensive directory of services and which forms of two factor authorisation they support, if they support 2FA at all.

***

#### [Cipher Identifier][cipher-id]
I partisapated in a Caputure the Flag even recently, my first. While trying to solve one of the decryption challenges I found this really cool site that can attempt to identify how a cipher text was encrypted.
