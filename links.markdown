### [Virtualization Applications Are Not Working: What Do You Do?][vmware] 

An article about VMWare and Hyper-V coexisting and some solutions and fixes for issues.

  

### [Git in Two Minutes][git]  

A really good guide to git and it's fundamental commands. Really handy as I use several regularly but most I forget every time I come back to them.
